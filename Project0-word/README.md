# Project 0: Word

## The goals of the project in short:

1. Create a program that take an argument of file path and return the number of words in the file.
2. Create a program that take an argument of file path and return the frequency of each word in the file.
3. Create the same program as the second goal but with limit the user input based on OS system resources limits (e.g. stack size, heap size, etc).
4. Play with debugger and answer the question in the `debugger.txt` file, moving from normal view to assembly view and back, giving the of call stack, translating commands to assembly, and more.
5. Answer some questions about the assembly code in the `call.txt` file.

> The project is intended to be done in C language, but I will do it in Zig language, so I will try to follow the same goals but in Zig language.
> But some of the goals may not be possible to do in Zig language, so I will try my best to do it in a similar way.

#### The design of the project can be found in the [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) file.

#### The project is the first in a series of projects that I will do to learn system programming in a deeper level.
