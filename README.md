# This project is a funtime project.
1. The goal is to enjoy and learn system programing in a deepr level.
2. Seconed goal is to learn ZIG and do everything in ZIG.
3. Third goal is to write multiplatform code, that can run on linux and maos, on 64 and 32 bit.
4. Fourth goal is to do every thing from the cli, including creating this repo on github with api, creating files, building, testing, running, and deploying.

In the project I'll use docker and qemu to run the code on different platforms, so I will also have some fun with docker and qemu.
