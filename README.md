# This project is a funtime project

1. The goal is to enjoy and learn system programming in a deeper level.
2. Second goal is to learn ZIG and do everything in ZIG.
3. Third goal is to write multiplatform code, that can run on linux and macos,
   on 64 and 32 bit.
4. Fourth goal is to do every thing from the cli,
   including creating this repo on github with api,
   creating files, building, testing, running, and deploying.

In the project I'll use docker and qemu to run the code on different platforms,
so I will also have some fun with docker and qemu.

## What I'm coding actually?

1. First I'll write a bunch of programs that are the basics of ZIG.
2. Second I'll work base on Berkeley C162 course
   which is [available for free on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2K2xZjNEf97A_uBCwEl61sdxWVP7VWC).
   The course is about system and system programming and it's in C,
   but I'll do it in ZIG.
   The course has [homeworks](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa22/static/hw/),
   so throw the course,
   I'll do the homework base on the timeline of the course
   (the timeline of me watching the course),
   and I'll do some stuff a bit different -
   I'll write my own docker images and qemu images, and I'll write the code in ZIG.
   Suppose to be fun. :woman_dancing:
